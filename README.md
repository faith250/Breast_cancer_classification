# Breast_cancer_classification
Creating a breast classification Machine learning model with using the different classification models 
1)Logistic Regression
2)K-Nearest Neighbors
3)Support Vector Machine
4)Decision Tree
5)Random Forest
6)Gradient Boosting
7)Naive Bayes
8)Artificial Neural Network
9)Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
with logistic regression giving th e best result 
and on checking the different number of epoches the accuracy becomes stagnent
